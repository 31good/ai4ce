# Project Overview

This repository provides scripts and tools for processing and recovering labels for KITTI 360 datasets and converting them to the Semantic KITTI format. The project involves multiple steps, including recovering labels for Velodyne frames, repositioning points using calibration and pose information, and generating the final semantic labels and invalid points for dynamic and static objects.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `recoverKITTI360label/`
- **Script: `recoverlabel.py`**
  - This script is used to recover labels for **every single frame** of Velodyne data from the KITTI 360 dataset.
  - The original implementation can be found in the [recoverKITTI360label repository](https://github.com/JulesSanchez/recoverKITTI360label).

### 2. `convert_360_to_kitti.py`
- **Script: `convert_360_to_kitti.py`**
  - This is a custom script that converts KITTI 360 data into the Semantic KITTI format.
  - It outputs both Velodyne point clouds and corresponding labels.
  - The script repositions the points using information from the calibration (`calib`) and pose data, generating newly structured data in Semantic KITTI format.

### 3. `semantic-mapping-api/`
- **Script: `ray_model.py`**
  - This script utilizes the **dynamic datapoints** created by `convert_360_to_kitti.py` and the **static datapoints** generated by `recoverlabel.py`.
  - It **concatenates** the dynamic and static data, creating the final label files and marking invalid areas.
  - This step is crucial because in the KITTI 360 dataset, static objects have stable datapoints across all frames. However, for the invalid point calculation, it's necessary to determine which parts of an object are visible in each frame, and which parts are occluded.
